# LearnPythonByReadingCode
This project aims at teaching Python by simplly reading source code. 
This source code is written so that, when sequenciially read, 
the reader becomes familar with python. 

# Pre Requirements

The course is meant for anyone that wants to learn Python with some knowledge of 
a programming language, even though I'm try to even eliminate that. It is important 
to already have a Python IDE installed, like Pycharm, VSCode or even "IDLE", the 
IDE which comes with Python. It is also assume that you already have either a 
version of Python installed (version greater than 3.3). The latest can always be found 
at:

> https://www.python.org/

But to even make the version of Python easy to change and your Python 
programs easy to share, I created the git:

> https://github.com/philips-labs/TruelyPortablePythonProjectTemplate

That is a way of having Python on your PC without it being "installed". Only in 
that way it is possible to work on different Python projects with different 
versions "simultaneously".

# The Course

The Python language is given in an explorative way: you start by reading the file:

> read_and_run_this_first.py
